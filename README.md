# Student-Registration-System
This is a project that was assigned to me in my CS 232 (Java) class. This program is a simplified version of the JSU student registration system. With this program student can register for classes in Mathematics and Computer Sciences courses that will be offered by JSU in the Spring 2018 semester.
